# ESP_MQTT
MQTT Connect from an ESP8266 (Micropython) to an Ubuntu Server (Broker and MySQL) and output to a Website (Apache, Mysql and PHP)

First we need an ESP8266 or ESP32 and Sensors ( I use an DHT22 for Air Humedy and Temperatur, an BMP180 for the Air Pressure and an Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor for the Soil Humity.

In the first Step i use Micropython to test and Configure the Board, Sensors and the Connection to the MQTT Broker
